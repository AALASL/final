# Final Project: Blackjack
This program is the casino game Blackjack, coded in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio. The game uses vectors, header files, console editing, writing to text files, and has around 800 lines of code in total. All you need to play the game is the .exe file, it will automatically create the scores.txt file to go along with it after you set your first high score. Report any bugs to the issue tracker <a href"https://github.com/AALASL/final/issues/new">here</a>, and we'll get to it when we get the chance. Please enjoy our game!
